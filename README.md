# 0x0F-unity-location-based

## This repo has been utilized for the purposes of presenting Padoru all over the world

## If you don't love Padoru, you are just wrong

## A lot of the code used in this repo was more for the sake of amusement and learning a little something extra. I was really appreciative of the opportunity

## The location services relied a bit on the math provided by https://github.com/MichaelTaylor3D/UnityGPSConverter

## ARCore and ARFoundation made the process far simpler to write.

# Gaze upon this link and tremble at the mighty Christmas Cryptid!

## Oh, and don't forget to send coffee to the developer!
